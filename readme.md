# data structures & algorithms

This repo is to be used for exploring data structures and algorithms.

I have to pick a language and, for production purposes, I'd pick C++ or even C (these days),
but I'll try Python, to make it easy to implement things in an interview.

## data structures

The structures I want to implement will contain the following:

* linked lists, simple, double, circular (they are the simplest expandable list, with O(n) search and O(1) insertion and deletion)
* trees, binary tree, n-ary-tree (they perform search generally in O(log b(N)) where b=base of logarithm and the number of branches per tree node)
* tries, graphs
* heaps (they generate the max or min value in O(n))
* Vectors / ArrayLists (?)
* Hashtables (they allow search usually in O(1), due to a hash function)

## algorithms

* breadth first search in a graph (traverse using a stack)
* depth first search in a graph (traverse using a queue)
* binary search (O(lgN))
* merge sort
* quick sort
